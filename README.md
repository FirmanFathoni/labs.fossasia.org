## FOSSASIA Labs: Projects and Idea Page

The goal of our labs is to bring projects to the next level and support them from idea stage to developing sustainable Open Source products. On this page we also share ideas for lab projects to involve new contributors through our coding programs and GSoC. FOSSASIA is proud to participate as a mentor organization for years in the Summer of Code and Code-In, where Google offers students stipends for internships to write code for open source projects.

## Google Summer of Code

FOSSASIA is proud to participate for several years as a mentor organization in the Summer of Code program of Google and at Google Code-In. Google Summer of Code offers students stipend to write code for our open source projects. Since 2011 FOSSASIA functions as an umbrella organization for a number of projects.

## Making Projects Sustainable

The goal of FOSSASIA Labs is to bring projects to the next level and support developers to make them sustainable.

In the software and hardware lab we onboard FOSSASIA developers who have an idea and want to start a new project or develop a new feature within a FOSSASIA program. We work with them to connect to like-minded developers online and through events. In the science hack lab we focus on educational instutions. And, in the incubation lab we work with teams to bring Open Source products to market. Check out Github projects to learn more about existing projects.
